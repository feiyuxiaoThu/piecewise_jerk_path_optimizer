# piecewise_jerk_path_optimizer
Pure C piecewise jerk path optimizer of Apollo for S-L Planning

*Note* This project heavily depends on the following open-source repos:

[qpSwift](https://github.com/qpSWIFT/qpSWIFT) Light-weight sparse Quadratic Programming Solver

[sparse_matrix_conversion](https://github.com/kmpape/sparse_matrix_conversion) Utilities to convert dense matrix formats to sparse matrix formats and the reverse.

## Dev Tasks

\- [ x] Construct a typical QP demo using the sparse_matrix_conversion Tool for creating sparse matrix.

\- [ ] Perform  piecewise_jerk_path_optimizer task in pure c code.
